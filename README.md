# Virtual-Memory-System

This project implements a virtual memory system (VM) using segmentation and paging. The system manages the necessary segment and page tables in a simulated main memory. It accepts virtual addresses and translates them into physical addresses according to the current contents of the segment and page tables. The system also utilizes a translation look-aside buffer (TLB) to make the translation process more efficient.
